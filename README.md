The Pomodoro Technique® is a popular time management method developed in the late 80's. 
It's really simple: You break down your work into 25 minutes intervals separated by short breaks.

Here's how it works:
1. Pick the tasks you need to accomplish during your currently work day or study time.
2. Start working for 25 minutes.
3. When the window pop-up, take a 5 minute break
4. Every fourth break should be long 30 minutes
